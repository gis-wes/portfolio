# Wes' GIS Portfolio

Completion of my GIS studies required a portfolio. I repurposed a project started while studying graphic design nearly a decade ago. Don't judge the technology choices I made at the time. Though it is satisfying to return to a dated codebase and heavily modify it with ease. This is reprentative of how I work with technology. Learn, reset, relearn.
